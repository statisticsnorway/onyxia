Here's what you need to know:

#### What are those Helm Commands?  

Theses commands are the exact Helm command that Onyxia API will execute on your behalf in your Kubernetes namespace.  
This enables you to know what's happening behind the scenes when you interact with the UI.  

#### Real-time Updates  

As you interact with the UI, the Helm commands will automatically update to reflect what you are doing.  

#### Why Should I Care?  

- **Transparency:** We believe you have the right to know what actions are being performed in your environment.  
- **Learning:** Understanding these commands can provide insight into Kubernetes and Helm, deepening your knowledge.  
- **Manual Execution:** You can copy and paste those commands into a terminal with write-access to Kubernetes, allowing you to launch the service manually.  

#### How Can I Run Those Commands Manually?

- **Local Terminal:** Go to [\`My Account -> Kubernetes tab\`](${k8CredentialsHref}).  
  Here, you will find the credentials that allow you to run commands in your Kubernetes namespace from your local terminal.  
`
}

- If this instance of onyxia features services VSCode or Jupyter you can open a terminal within theses services and run command there.  
  For constructive or destructive commands you will need to launch your service with Kubernetes role \`admin\` or \`edit\`.  

By executing the command manually, you will still be able to see the service in the [\`MyServices\`](${myServicesHref}) page as if it was launched via the UI.  

You can disable the command bar in the [\`My Account -> Interface preference tab\`](${interfacePreferenceHref}).

Feel free to explore and take charge of your Kubernetes deployments!
